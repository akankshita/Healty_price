<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

<p>HealthyPrice aims to aggregate in a website high quality healthcare services at fixed prices that are fair to both customers and patients as well as to the doctors and other healthcare providers that offer such services.  Prices are to be established at fair market rates based on cash being paid for the service, at rates traditionally much lower than what is billed to insurance companies, and to be paid for by customers via electronic cash means on the website.  HealthyPrice's website will allow customers, who don't have or don't want to use traditional health insurance, to easily find and pay for healthcare.  A goal of HealthyPrice is to alleviate customers' misconceptions and fears about the perceived unaffordability of health care when paid for by cash, and to relieve healthcare providers of the administration of negotiating and collecting fees from cash-paying customers.</p>
