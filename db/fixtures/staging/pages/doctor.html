<h3>Are You a Doctor or Healthcare Provider?</h3>

<p><strong>Become a member now.  It’s easy and free.</strong></p>

<p>If you are a doctor or healthcare provider, we invite you to join the HealthyPrice family.  It’s simple and free to join.  One of our aims is to bring organization and clarity to the marketplace and make it easier for doctors to get paid for healthcare needs.  Provider members enjoy benefits that include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>You Choose the Services or Procedures to Offer.</strong>  Browse through our standardized listing of services and procedures that are common to your specialty practice area.  Select the ones you wish to offer to our customers.  It’s your choice.  Choose as few (minimum one) or as many as you desire.  Our focus is on the more common needs to our customers, so you won’t see every imaginable procedure in your area.</li>

	<li><strong>Fair Pricing.</strong>  Our prices for our listing of services and procedures are fair.  It is based on thorough market analysis that matches or is greater than the going rates for cash based patients.  You see the price you’ll get on our website and that is the price you’ll be paid.  Our prices won’t go lower without giving you advance notice and will never change on orders already placed or appointments scheduled.</li>

	<li><strong>Fast Billing and Payment Process.</strong>  We take care of the customer billing for you.  Once a patient has ordered a service or procedure from you, and you’ve seen the patient, you get paid quick.  At the time of the patient visit, the patient will give you a HealthyPrice “billing code” upon checking in for the appointment.  You log in online to your HealthyPrice account (or phone call into our system) to indicate the billing code number.  Within a few business days, HealthyPrice processes your payment to you.  No need to complete onerous administrative billing procedures.  No need to wait for months to get paid (like you do now from the insurance companies).  We guarantee payment to you.  <a href="/page/payment_process">Click here for more on the customer order and doctor payment process.</a></li>

	<li><strong>Customers.  Customers.  Customers.</strong>  HealthyPrice is seeking to become the number one place for patients who need or want healthcare but either don’t have health insurance or don’t have adequate coverage under their existing plan.  We do the marketing and customer lead generation for you.  Our expectations are that our website will soon be viewed by millions of unique visitors each month.  Again, one of our goals is to bring organization and clarity to the marketplace. Through HealthyPrice, our customers will have a go-to source for easily identifiable healthcare needs and will learn how affordable and attainable healthcare really can be.  HealthyPrice is an abundant supply of customers and patients for you.</li>

	<li><strong>Discounts and Specials.</strong>  From time to time, HealthyPrice will have various discounts and specials for complementary items to your practice.  These may include coupons for medications at local pharmacies, specials on lab work at participating facilities, and other various benefits.  As a provider member of HealthyPrice, you will be able to pass on these perks to your patients.</li>

	<li><strong>Ownership in HealthyPrice.</strong>  For a period of time, initial doctors who join HealthyPrice will be granted equity ownership in our company.  We are serious about our partnership with you and want you to be part of the growth and excitement of our company.  This benefit will be free to you simply for becoming a member.  We will talk to you more about your equity ownership in HealthyPrice during the membership process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you ready to join now?  Simply sign up by filling out our basic HealthyPrice application online.  Within a few business days or less, we will review for approval.  Once you’re approved, a HealthyPrice doctor profile account will instantly be established and you can log in to manage your profile and choose the services and procedures you wish to offer.  You’re all set then for HealthyPrice customers.  It’s as easy as that.  Again, it’s free.  No hidden charges, no monthly fees.</p>
