<h3>What is credentialing?</h3>

<p>Credentialing is a systematic approach to collection and verification of a practitioner applicant's professional qualifications, such as relevant training, licensure, certification, and/or registration to practice in a healthcare field, and academic background, as well as an assessment of whether the practitioner meets certain criteria relating to professional competence and conduct. The credentialing organizationâ€™s process evaluates the qualifications of practitioners who provide care to their members. This process is completed before a practitioner is accepted for participation in the organization.</p>
