<h3>ABOUT US</h3>

<p>HealthyPrice is based in Burbank, California and was started in 2009 from the ideas of two medical doctors who believe that most people don’t understand how easy and affordable healthcare might be when you have to pay for it by cash or equivalent means.  Amongst the confusing and unorganized healthcare industry, HealthyPrice has struck arrangements with doctors and healthcare providers to clearly offer basic healthcare procedures and services at very reasonable prices.  Our website and catalog of healthcare services aims to simplify the ability to find and pay for healthcare.  HealthyPrice is also an efficient and effective system for collecting fees from patients and paying doctors and healthcare providers -- they don’t have to worry about negotiating prices with patients, nor bill or collect payment from them. </p>

<p>Currently launched in Los Angeles County, HealthyPrice plans to expand nationally over the next year.  It is believed that HealthyPrice will be the recognized source for those who don’t have healthcare insurance, or for those whose policy doesn’t cover a particular healthcare need, to easily find and pay for healthcare services and procedures.</p>

<p>HealthyPrice is not an insurance provider and has no affiliation with any insurance organization.</p>
