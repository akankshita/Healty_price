<h3>How Affordable Are We?</h3>

<p>A common misconception is that many of the basic medical procedures are too expensive and cost into the thousands of dollars.  That is simply not true in most cases.  A lot of this confusion stems from charges that people remember as part of the insurance billing process.  There is a large difference between what doctors bill the insurance company versus what they ultimately get paid by the insurance company.  Moreover, when a patient must pay the doctor in cash or with a credit/debit card (e.g. not through insurance), the price the doctor charges is different again.  People generally are accustomed to thinking of medical costs based on the charges billed by the doctors to the insurance companies.  The truth is that when you pay cash for medical services, a doctor will generally accept from 30% to 50% of what would otherwise be billed to the insurance company!  Doctors, on the other hand, struggle with how and what to charge customers who pay by cash or credit/debit card.</p>
